# Simplifying Polyline
The program demonstrates the operation of the algorithm for simplifying the Ramer-Douglas-Pecker polyline on the line that the user sets with the mouse
The user draws a line on the form while holding down the mouse button. The input data for the algorithm is a sequence of points (x, y) obtained by mouse movements (MouseMove) forming the initial polyline, and the parameter ε > 0, which sets the maximum allowable distance between the initial and simplified polyline. The result of the algorithm is a simplified polyline defined by a subset of points that are determined from the original polyline

The program provides interactive redrawing of a simplified polyline when the parameter ε is changed
